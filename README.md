# Jack-O-Linter

In software development, both static and dynamic analysis play critical roles in ensuring code quality. Static analysis tools evaluate code without executing it, detecting potential issues such as syntax errors, “code smells”, and style inconsistencies. Dynamic analysis tools, on the other hand, inspect the behavior of code during execution, identifying runtime issues like unhandled exceptions, performance bottlenecks, and potential security vulnerabilities. This project aims to create a unified tool, `Jack-o-Linter`, which integrates both static and dynamic analysis methods to assess Python codebases for maintainability, complexity, type safety, and security concerns.
